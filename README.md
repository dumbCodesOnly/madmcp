## What this is

`madmcp` is a single MCP server that gives an AI agent tool-level access to
real infrastructure — GitHub, Cloudflare, Notion, Mem0, and arbitrary web
pages — so agent workflows can read and write directly instead of relying on
manual copy/paste between tabs.

## Live demo

An illustrative six-step walkthrough of a mock incident response — finding a
slow endpoint, checking latency metrics, shipping and reviewing a fix, and
logging it to memory — touching all five connectors in one flow (including a
deeper look at Mem0's semantic dedup and relation-graph tools), with a synced
status panel and live call/latency stats alongside the trace. Sample data
throughout, not a live call. (If GitHub Pages isn't enabled for this repo
yet, open `demo.html` directly.)

## Deploy & connect (quickstart)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/allocsys/madmcp)
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/allocsys/madmcp&env=MCP_SHARED_KEY,GITHUB_TOKEN,NOTION_TOKEN,MEM0_API_KEY,CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN,CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID&envDescription=Generate+a+long+random+string+yourself+for+MCP_SHARED_KEY+(Vercel+can%27t+auto-generate+it).+Leave+any+connector+token+blank+to+skip+it.&envLink=https://github.com/allocsys/madmcp%23configuration&project-name=manufact-mcp-server&repository-name=manufact-mcp-server)

Get tokens, deploy, connect to Claude — in that order.

**1. Deploy it — pick a host.** Both buttons above deploy this repo as-is,
no Dockerfile or CLI needed, but they're not identical:

- **Render** reads `render.yaml` and generates `MCP_SHARED_KEY` for you
  automatically — one less thing to get wrong. Trade-off: the free plan
  spins down after 15 minutes idle, so the first request after a quiet
  period is slow (~30s cold start). Fine for testing; upgrade to a paid plan
  if you want Claude's calls to stay consistently fast.
- **Vercel** deploys with zero config (this repo's `server.js` already
  matches what Vercel expects) and its Fluid compute avoids Render's
  cold-start spin-down. Trade-off: you have to generate `MCP_SHARED_KEY`
  yourself — any long random string, e.g. via a password generator or
  `openssl rand -hex 32` — and paste it into the form; Vercel's button
  can't auto-fill it the way Render's blueprint does.

- **[Manufact Cloud](https://manufact.com/cloud)** is purpose-built for hosting
  MCP servers (this one included — the default IP allowlist already carries a
  comment about Manufact's own deploy-time health check). It doesn't have a
  one-click button with a public URL scheme the way Render/Vercel do; instead
  sign in, **New Server → Import from GitHub →** pick this repo, add your env
  vars on the **Configure Deployment** screen (or paste a `.env`), then
  **Deploy**. Node.js is auto-detected from `package.json`, no Dockerfile
  needed. Free tier scales to zero like Render's free tier (cold starts);
  paid plans offer "Prevent Scale to Zero." Manufact's gateway URL pattern is
  `https://<slug>.run.mcp-use.com/mcp` — the `/mcp/<key>` path-auth variant
  this repo uses does survive that gateway routing (confirmed: it's the exact
  pattern in use), so the same `https://<slug>.run.mcp-use.com/mcp/<your
  MCP_SHARED_KEY>` URL from step 5 below works here too.

Prefer another host, or running it yourself? It's a plain Node/Express app —
`npm install && npm start`, listens on `$PORT` (default `8080`) — so any
Node-friendly host (Railway, Fly.io, etc.) or your own server works too,
just without any platform's auto-fill.

*A note on IP allowlisting across hosts:* the allowlist trusts one
reverse-proxy hop by default (`TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`, default `1`), which
matches Render and most single-CDN-hop platforms. If Claude's calls get
unexpectedly 403'd on a different platform, that hop count is the first
thing to check — adjust `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`, or temporarily set
`IP_ALLOWLIST_ENABLED=false` to confirm that's the cause before tightening
it back up.

**2. Collect tokens for the connectors you want.** Each is independent —
skip any you don't need, its tools just fail at call time instead of
blocking the rest.

| Connector | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| GitHub | github.com/settings/tokens → fine-grained PAT, scoped to specific repos |
| Notion | notion.so/my-integrations → create an integration, then share the relevant pages/databases with it |
| Mem0 | app.mem0.ai → API keys |
| Cloudflare | dash.cloudflare.com → My Profile → API Tokens, plus your Account ID from the dashboard sidebar |

**3. Set two security env vars — don't skip these.**
- `MCP_SHARED_KEY` — any long random string. Unset = `/mcp` is open to
  anyone who has your server's URL, tokens and all.
- `IP_ALLOWLIST_ENABLED` — on by default, pre-set to Claude's published
  connector IP range, so leave it alone if you're only ever connecting from
  Claude.ai. Set it to `false` temporarily to test with curl/Postman from
  your own machine first.

**4. Deploy, then verify.** `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`, no auth
needed. `GET /` (needs your `x-manufact-key` header — this endpoint doesn't
support the path-key variant) reports which connectors are configured, so
you can confirm your tokens landed.

**5. Add it to Claude.** Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector, using:

```
https://<your-host>/mcp/<your MCP_SHARED_KEY>
```

(Path-based, since Claude.ai's connector UI doesn't currently support
header-based auth for MCP servers.)

See **Configuration** below for the full variable reference.

## Configuration

All tokens are optional independently — a connector's tools fail at call time
(not startup) if its token is missing.

| Variable | Required for |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub tools |
| `NOTION_TOKEN` | Notion tools |
| `MEM0_API_KEY` | Mem0 tools (`MEM0_USER_ID` optional, defaults to `default`) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare tools |
| `DEFAULT_OWNER` | Default GitHub owner when omitted from a call (defaults to `allocsys`) |
| `MCP_SHARED_KEY` | Shared-secret auth for `/mcp`. Unset = endpoint is open to anyone with the URL — set this in any real deployment. |
| `IP_ALLOWLIST_ENABLED` | Set `false` to disable the IP allowlist (default: enabled) |
| `ALLOWED_IP_RANGES` | Comma-separated CIDR ranges allowed to call `/mcp` (defaults to Anthropic's published connector range) |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` | Number of reverse-proxy hops to trust for client-IP detection (default `1`, matches Render). Adjust if deploying behind a different proxy chain. |

## Security notes

- Requests to `/mcp` are restricted by IP allowlist and rate-limited (30 requests/min).
- Scope `GITHUB_TOKEN` as narrowly as possible (ideally fine-grained, limited
  to specific repos). This server can create/delete repos and files, merge
  PRs, and delete Cloudflare resources — treat every configured token as
  live write access.
- `GET /` reports which connectors are configured; `GET /health` stays open
  and info-free for uptime checks.
- Rotate any token if you ever suspect it's been exposed.
